title: " "
excerpt: "Developing theoretically justifiable and practically scalable methods for large **streaming dependent data** is the primary motivation for my research. 
My research focuses on developing a series of **sampling methods** for temporal or spatial dependent data in the streaming data setting and the decentralized data acquisition environment. For statistical methodology, the techniques of *sequential analysis*, *online learning* and *decentralized optimization* have been integrated into my proposed sampling methods."
