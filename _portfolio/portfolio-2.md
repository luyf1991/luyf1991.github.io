My research develops data-dependent sampling methods for streaming temporal correlated data and provides the necessary statistical analysis of the proposed sampling paradigms.
Of particular interest is when the data-dependent sampling procedure selects data points according to a probability distribution that depends on the statistical leverage scores of the input data. Such leverage sampling paradigms concentrate more on influential data units and has already yielded impressive algorithmic benefits, e.g., for matrix approximation and standard linear regression. However, the traditional leverage sampling methods are developed for independent data. It has been well established that ignoring dependence may lead to biased estimation and inference. Therefore, much of my work aims to tackle the question of how to design sampling methods for time-dependent data, where the data may be collected in a streaming fashion or from a decentralized/distributed environment.
