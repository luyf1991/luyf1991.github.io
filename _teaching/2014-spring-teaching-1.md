During my Ph.D. studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I worked as an instructor and teaching assistant for two undergrad classes (Design and Manufacture ME 3210, Machine Design ME 3180 and Experimental Lab ME 3057) in the Mechanical Engineering Department. I enjoyed sharing my experience in the manufacturing industry with my students and exchanging ideas with them.
