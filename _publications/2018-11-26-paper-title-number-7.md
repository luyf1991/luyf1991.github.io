The rapid convergence rate, high fidelity learning outcome
and low computational cost are key targets in solving the
learning problem of the complex physical system. Guided
by physical laws of wave propagation, in full waveform
inversion (FWI), we learn the subsurface images through optimizing
the media velocity model in a large scale non-linear
problem. In this paper, we combine randomized subsampling
techniques with a second-order optimization algorithm to
propose the Sub-Sampled Newton (SSN) method for learning
velocity model of FWI. By incorporating the curvature
information, SSN preserves comparable convergence rate to
Newtons method and significantly reduces the iteration cost
by approximating the Hessian matrix through a non-uniform
subsampling scheme. The numerical experiments demonstrate
that the proposed SSN method has a faster convergence
rate, and achieves a more accurate velocity model in terms of
mean squared error than commonly used methods.
