In order to directly obtain the reflectivity series from seismic data, we develop an advanced reflectivity inversion method. The choice between $L_1$ and $L_2$ norm minimization is always difficult for the conventional reflectivity inversion methods, which also require the selection of regularization terms. The proposed method adopts $L_q$ norm ($0 < q < 1$) minimization and optimal regularization parameter selection. In the beginning, we discuss the validity of the non-convex constraint, and the advantage of the Lq norm constraint. Then we briefly introduce the optimal regularization parameter selection based on cross-validation.The performance of the proposed method in the synthetic examples with different noise levels shows that the inverted results are reasonable in the cases with moderate noises. In the end, a field example from the Barnett Shale proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.
